// Package mqtt connects to an MQTT broker in order to communicate with a gateway.
//
// Connection/Disconnection of gateways is done by publishing messages to the
// "connect" and "disconnect" topics. When a gateway connects, it (or a plugin
// of the MQTT broker) should publish a types.ConnectMessage to the "connect"
// topic conteining the gateway's ID and either a key or a token
// (`{"id":"[gateway-id]","token":"[gateway-token]"}`).
//
// The gateway (or the plugin) can also set a will with the MQTT broker for
// when it disconnects. This will should be a types.DisconnectMessage on the
// "disconnect" topic (`{"id":"[gateway-id]"}``).
//
// Uplink messages are sent as protocol buffers on the "[gateway-id]/up" topic.
// The bridge should call `SubscribeUplink("gateway-id")` to subscribe to this
// topic. It is also possible to subscribe to a wildcard gateway by passing "+".
//
// Downlink messages are sent as protocol buffers on the "[gateway-id]/down"
// topic. The bridge should call `PublishDownlink(*types.DownlinkMessage)` in
// order to send the downlink to the gateway.
//
// Gateway status messages are sent as protocol buffers on the
// "[gateway-id]/status" topic. The bridge should call
// `SubscribeStatus("gateway-id")` to subscribe to this topic. It is also
// possible to subscribe to a wildcard gateway by passing "+".
