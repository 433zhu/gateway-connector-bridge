// Package amqp connects to an AMQP server in order to communicate with a gateway.
//
// Connection/Disconnection of gateways is done by publishing messages to the
// "connect" and "disconnect" routing keys. When a gateway connects, it (or a
// plugin on the broker) should publish a types.ConnectMessage to the "connect"
// routing key. This message should contain the gateway's ID, and either a key
// or a token (`{"id":"[gateway-id]","token":"[gateway-token]"}`).
//
// The gateway (or the plugin) can send a types.DisconnectMessage on the
// "disconnect" topic (`{"id":"[gateway-id]"}``) when it disconnects, in order
// to help the bridge clean up connections.
//
// Uplink messages are sent as protocol buffers on the "[gateway-id].up" routing
// key. The bridge should call `SubscribeUplink("gateway-id")` to subscribe to
// these. It is also possible to subscribe to a wildcard gateway by passing "*".
//
// Downlink messages are sent as protocol buffers on the "[gateway-id].down"
// routing key. The bridge should call `PublishDownlink(*types.DownlinkMessage)`
// in order to send the downlink to the gateway.
//
// Gateway status messages are sent as protocol buffers on the
// "[gateway-id].status" routing key. The bridge should call
// `SubscribeStatus("gateway-id")` to subscribe to these. It is also possible to
// subscribe to a wildcard gateway by passing "*".
